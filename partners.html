<p>The Community is developing a site where you can volunteer to become a Community Partner. This website will provide for a full collection of information about yourself you wish to provide. Each partner will log into the website using their credentials. They can choose to participate in the activities of any of the projects that are ongoing and listed for them. The participation in the Projects is by invitation of the leaders of the project once a Partner offers to participate in the project. Those who initiate the project with the community will form a leadership team for that project. They will be linked to each other by systems on the Project website and can join and participate in the success of that project.</p>

<p>Each Community Partner will have a Page on the website auto generated where they can put out information about who they are and what business or welfare or school or goods they sell. Links to where they have facebook or other sites will be incorporated.</p>
<p> Give us your views on support@mail.bircom.in.</p>
